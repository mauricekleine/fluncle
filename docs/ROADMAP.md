# Roadmap

Forward-facing, roughly prioritized list of open work — what we pick from next. Not a changelog: shipped work lives in git history, so this doc carries only what's still ahead. A living reference; add freely, move an item into a PR when it's picked up. Canon (DESIGN.md / PRODUCT.md / VOICE.md) arbitrates the words — this is planning, not spec.

## Now — the production loop is running

The add → live pipeline is operational end to end:

- **One `/admin` cockpit** — every finding is a row with its derived stage (Enrich · Tag · YouTube · TikTok), stage worklists, and the publish controls; the old `/admin/tag` + `/admin/posts` pages folded into it.
- **Hands-off rendering** — a Claude scheduled **routine** ("Fluncle video queue") fires hourly on the Mac, films exactly the oldest queued finding end to end with the `fluncle-video` skill, then stops (queue-gated, one finding per tick; a no-op when the queue is empty or the laptop's asleep). The backlog is essentially full — 25 of 26 findings have a clip.
- **Publishing** — driven from the board: YouTube Shorts hands-off (title + caption + `cover.jpg` thumbnail via the API), TikTok as a drafted inbox post the operator finishes in-app. The in-app sound/cover/schedule flow and the ≤ 5-drafts/24h TikTok cadence live in the `fluncle-publish` skill.

What's left of the loop is ongoing operation, not build work. The fully-autonomous, server-side version — chaining enrich → render → publish without the laptop in the loop — lives in **Later → TikTok auto-pipeline**.

### The autonomy ladder

The full path a finding travels, top to bottom: one human act, then how far it propagates on its own. `[x]` = automated today, `[ ]` = a manual/operator step (some manual by design, like the add and TikTok). A final group is **deferred** — surfaces we could reach but deliberately leave dark for now (no box, because nothing happens there yet).

**0 · Find + add** — the one irreducible human act ("Maurice discovers, Fluncle does the rest"):

- [ ] Maurice finds the banger and adds it (`fluncle admin add`, the `/admin` board, or `ssh rave.fluncle.com`). Manual by design — this is the whole point.

**1 · Synchronous fan-out** — instant, the moment the Worker writes the finding and assigns its Log ID it is everywhere the spine reaches:

- [x] **Spotify** — added to the Fluncle's Findings playlist
- [x] **Telegram** — posted to the crew channel
- [x] **Web** — live in the feed and at its `/log/<id>` page
- [x] **CLI** — `fluncle recent`, `fluncle log <id>`
- [x] **API** — `/api/tracks`, `/api/tracks/<idOrLogId>`
- [x] **MCP** — the Model Context Protocol server
- [x] **RSS** — `/rss.xml`, the observation feed
- [x] **SSH rave terminal** — `ssh rave.fluncle.com`
- [x] **Galaxy game (web)** — a collectible star at its Log ID coordinate
- [x] **Galaxy game (SSH)** — the same star in the terminal galaxy

**2 · Async, automated** — no laptop-tap, no human; they just run:

- [x] **Enrichment (Spinup)** — BPM, key, and the `features_json` spectral vector; fired on add (`enrichmentStatus: processing → done`). See _Later → TikTok auto-pipeline → Autonomous trigger_.
- [x] **Render (local Claude routine)** — the hourly "Fluncle video queue" films the oldest queued finding end to end and uploads to R2; idle when the queue is empty. See _Now → Hands-off rendering_.

**3 · The manual tail** — what still needs a hand, roughly in order, and where each one automates:

- [ ] **Tag** the vibe (`vibe_x`/`vibe_y` → galaxy) on the board. Automates via the _Vibe-placement model_ (gated on ~50–100 labels).
- [ ] **Note** the editorial "why". Automates via _Auto-drafted finding notes_ (downstream of the vibe model + a notes corpus).
- [ ] **YouTube** Shorts — the operator triggers the push today (the upload itself is hands-off: title + caption + `cover.jpg` thumbnail). Goes fully auto when the server-side chain extends — the one channel that needs no in-app finish. See _Later → TikTok auto-pipeline → More platforms_.
- [ ] **TikTok** — drafted to the inbox from the board; the operator finishes in-app (attach the official sound, publish). Manual by design — no legitimate API audio path. The last per-finding beat. See _Later → TikTok auto-pipeline_.
- [ ] **Newsletter (Friday)** — the Spinup agent drafts the weekly letter on its own (finds grouped by galaxy, scene tidbits via firecrawl), but the **send is a manual tap** in Loops (no campaign-send API). The one weekly-cadence step; everything above it is per-finding. See _Later → Newsletter agent_.

**4 · Deferred (on purpose)** — a surface we could reach but are choosing to leave dark for now:

- **Instagram** (`@fluncle`) — the account exists, but we're not posting yet. The music-licensing exposure isn't worth it: there's no legitimate API audio path (the master gets muted on a business/creator account, and IG's licensed audio is app-only), so it would mean either silent clips or manual in-app posts under that licensing risk. Parked, not closed. See _Later → TikTok auto-pipeline → More platforms_.

**The shape:** one human add → instant parallel fan-out to ~10 surfaces → two automated async agents (enrich, render) → a shrinking manual tail. Of that tail, tag + note fall to the vibe model and YouTube to the server-side chain; TikTok and the Friday newsletter send stay deliberate human taps, each blocked by an external platform limit, not by us.

## Next — surface what we make, and tidy reliability

### Backfill the new per-finding enrichments across the catalogue

The just-shipped enrichments only fire **going forward** — `publishTrack` loves on Last.fm + resolves the Discogs release, and the `/observe` endpoint renders an audio observation, all on new adds/enriches. The existing catalogue (~26 findings) needs a one-time backfill — which doubles as the **end-to-end test** that each new pipeline actually works against real findings:

- **Last.fm loves** — sweep every published finding and `track.love` it on the `fluncle` account (love-on-add only catches new publishes). Free, fast, idempotent; gated only on the three `LASTFM_*` Worker secrets being set.
- **Context notes** (`context_note`) — firecrawl-derived facts per finding; **produced inside the observation render** (`/observe` fetches the context as it renders), so not a separate free pass. The pipeline still needs a **context-prep step** to be truly autonomous: the doctrine says the agent writes the script _from_ these facts, but the agent holds only `FLUNCLE_API_TOKEN` (firecrawl is Worker-only) and the Worker fetches context only _during_ the render — so the script can't yet be grounded in the facts it's meant to use. Fix: a Worker `observe-context` endpoint + CLI that runs the firecrawl search and **returns the facts to the agent** (keeping firecrawl Worker-side), so the flow is context → script → render. (For the first manual proof we run the local `firecrawl` CLI in its place.)
- **Audio observations** — render the ElevenLabs observation per finding via `POST /api/admin/tracks/:id/observe`. Costs ElevenLabs credits and the voice is still the placeholder (`EkK5I93…`), so do this **after** the voice is dialed in — but a handful now is the real test of the pipeline + the `/log` audio control.
- **Discogs release IDs** — the hardened, gated resolver shipped (#46: MusicBrainz-first by ISRC, then a scored Discogs search with a **tracklist-confirm gate**, storing only ≥0.90-confidence matches — a wrong ID is worse than none). Backfill the catalogue through it: confident matches store `in_release_id`/`in_master_id`, the rest stay **unresolved by design** (don't force them). `DISCOGS_USER_TOKEN` is set, so it runs whenever the sweep does. (A `candidates` admin-review tier for near-miss 0.7–0.9 matches is the natural follow-up if too many land unresolved.)
- **(If it ships)** album-art → R2 ingestion, same sweep shape.

Shape: a one-shot, idempotent admin sweep (a `fluncle admin … backfill` command or a script over the catalogue) — skip already-done rows, respect rate limits (Discogs ~60/min) and vendor cost (ElevenLabs), best-effort per finding. The only truly-free pass is the **Last.fm loves**; the context note is coupled to the (paid) observation render, so do a handful of observations once the voice is tuned. Needs the relevant Worker secrets set and the build deployed first.

### Audio observation — voice guide + Fluncle's own voice

The pipeline is live and proven end-to-end (first render: `020.0.5L` — Ownglow "Do U?", a real grounded observation on its `/log` page). Two things gate doing it for real, both about the _voice_:

- **Finetune the Recovered-audio voice guide.** The VOICE.md §5 register + the script craft are a first draft. Tighten the writing guide for the _spoken_ observation: the arc (sensory → mood → connection → log ID → artist/title), line length and pacing for a heard surface (a clunky line can't be skimmed past), `<break>` use, how hard the cosmos-sauce should ride out loud, and where "too purple" begins. Fold Maurice's notes from the first renders back into `observation-agent.md` + VOICE.md §5.
- **Find or create Fluncle's voice.** The current `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID` (`EkK5I93…`) is a stock ElevenLabs default — fine for the proof, too generic to ship. Find a better-fitting ElevenLabs voice, or create a bespoke one (Maurice records a sample → ElevenLabs voice clone/design), then swap the `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID` secret. **This is the gate before backfilling observations** — anything rendered in the placeholder would need re-rendering, so lock the voice first.

### radio.fluncle.com needs a video backfill (landscape + text-free portrait)

Standing up `radio.fluncle.com` (Unit B of the audio-observation RFC, `docs/rfcs/radio-observations.md`) — a station that plays each finding's video under its observation audio — surfaces two video gaps the current clips don't cover, both requiring a re-render of the catalogue on the `packages/video` side:

- **Landscape renders per track** — for full-screen radio mode; today every clip is portrait (the RFC already parks landscape behind this).
- **Portrait renders without the text overlay** — so the radio UI draws its own metadata over clean footage instead of fighting the baked-in Log ID / caption.

So radio isn't only the audio backfill — it needs a **video backfill** too. Scope it alongside the radio surface; noted here so it isn't forgotten.

### CLI + admin-command naming polish

The `fluncle admin …` surface grew fast across these slices and the new commands are dash-separated ad hoc (`auth-lastfm`, `track observe`, the coming `track observe-context`, …). Once all the in-flight slices land, do one pass to make the command tree consistent and read well — group/verb/noun structure, naming, help text — so the CLI feels designed, not accreted. Cosmetic, low-risk, deliberately deferred until the surface stops moving.

### Log IDs in search + AI answers (AEO/GEO) — off-site thread

The on-site layer shipped (per-finding `/log/<id>` pages with definitional prose + `MusicRecording` identifiers, the `/log` index, sitemap enumeration, the `/about` entity/FAQ surface, one canonical description everywhere). What remains is off-site and slower:

- **AI crawlers: verified allowed (2026-06-11), keep the regression check.** The dashboard confirms verified AI crawlers pass (ClaudeBot 24 allowed requests, 38 crawls answered 200, the sitemap the most-crawled path); the earlier 403s were Cloudflare's spoof-detection rejecting fake-UA probes, not a block. Managed robots.txt is OFF. Still worth a recurring check of the live `/robots.txt` + the AI Crawl Control crawler policies (Cloudflare can re-flip defaults silently).
- **Submit + monitor.** Sitemap submitted to GSC and Bing (2026-06-11); watch the _set_ of log pages move to Indexed (count ≈ archive size); verify bare-token retrieval (`004.7.2I`, `fluncle://004.7.2I`) lands the log page. Check Fluncle is present in Brave Search. **First retrieval confirmed (2026-06-17), faster than the "weeks-out" estimate:** a bare `"004.6.0Q"` Google query returns the owned `fluncle.com/log` surface (#2), the YouTube Short caption (#1, with the coordinate + `Found Jun 3` rendered verbatim), and the gate-screen OG card (`packages/media`) in Images — within ~3 days of publish. Remaining granular milestones: the per-finding `/log/<id>` pages moving to Indexed in GSC (today the bare coordinate lands the `/log` _index_, not yet the individual page), and confirming an individual page ranks for its own coordinate. Indexing and AI citation are still ongoing outcomes — monitoring, not ship gates.
- **Third-party corroboration: the anchors exist (2026-06-11).** MusicBrainz artist `53346748-1357-45c0-a847-9d248b65d655` (Person, homepage/TikTok/Telegram links) and Wikidata item `Q140169844` (instance of human, official website, MusicBrainz artist ID, TikTok + Telegram usernames); both are in the `/about` `sameAs` set. Remaining: authentic presence where dnb lives (r/DnB and friends — participate, don't fabricate), and enrich the Wikidata item as facts accumulate.

### Developer & discovery surfaces — dig, versioned API, docs hub, feeds, CLI distribution (shipped)

The machine- and developer-facing reach of `docs/public-surfaces-checklist.md` landed (2026-06-20):

- **`dig.fluncle.com`** — a custom Go authoritative DNS server on the rave VPS, under a delegated zone, answers `dig <coord>.dig.fluncle.com TXT` plus the `random` / `latest` labels, returning a finding's metadata as a `v=fluncle1` TXT line. The delightful-obsession surface, ~free on the box; documented in the `/docs` dig guide. (`today` label still open; coordinate **web** subdomains were dropped — they add nothing over `/log/<id>` and were the only thing needing Cloudflare for SaaS, so `dig` carries the per-coordinate novelty instead.)
- **API v1** — every route mounts at `/api/v1/*` with `/api/*` kept as permanent back-compat aliases (shared handlers, not redirects, so POST bodies survive); spec at `/api/v1/openapi.json`.
- **`/docs` hub** — a Fumadocs site (CLI / SSH / MCP / dig / feeds / Log-ID / API-overview guides) with the **Scalar** API reference embedded at `/docs/api`.
- **Feeds** — JSON Feed (`/feed.json`), Atom (`/atom.xml`), the mixtape Podcast RSS (`/podcast.xml`), and `/calendar.ics` of planned live sessions.
- **CLI distribution** — the one CLI source ships three ways at one CI-aligned version (**0.33.0**): the public npm package `fluncle` (OIDC trusted publishing, no token), a Homebrew tap (`mauricekleine/homebrew-fluncle`), and GitHub Release binaries — all bumped together by `cli-release.yml` on any `apps/cli/**` change.
- **SSH deep-links** — `ssh rave.fluncle.com latest | random | <coord>` jump straight to a finding in the terminal.

What's left is the non-gating long tail in the checklist: the `today` dig label, a public changelog, a Docker image / Postman collection, broader data-graph anchors (Discogs, Last.fm, ListenBrainz), and directory listings (Product Hunt, Internet Archive, a Hugging Face dataset). Pick from `docs/public-surfaces-checklist.md` when one earns its keep.

### Database latency — evaluate Turso → Cloudflare D1

Turso (libSQL) is the source of truth, hosted in **Ireland**, so every Worker→DB read pays a cross-region hop — a real chunk of the `/log/<id>` ~896 ms cold TTFB (the Worker runs at the edge near the reader; the database doesn't). Cloudflare-native **D1** co-locates with Workers and would shrink that roundtrip. The catch is migration cost: D1 is SQLite with its own ceilings (database-size and write-throughput limits, no libSQL-only features), and the whole Drizzle data layer, migration history, and the per-worktree local-dev story (`turso dev` + `.dev/local.db`, see `docs/local-database.md`) would move with it — a real arc, not a config flip.

Near-term the cheaper win is **edge-caching the `/log` HTML** (short TTL + stale-while-revalidate + purge-on-publish) — scoped separately. Treat D1 as the deeper structural lever: pursue it when DB latency (not render time or asset weight) is the proven bottleneck. Spike it first — confirm D1's limits fit the catalogue and access patterns, and that nothing in the current libSQL usage is load-bearing — before committing to the migration.

### Fluncle's own mixtapes — spine + admin + autopublish shipped

The mixtape spine is **live** and the admin + cover + draft model were overhauled (PR #22, 2026-06-19, on top of the #18/#20/#21 plumbing). A mixtape is a spine-native object — Fluncle dreaming, a checkpoint — with its own `F`-marked Log ID, a `/log/<id>` compilation page, a `/mixtapes` front door, quiet feed / `recent` / MCP inclusion (without inflating `Found · N`), `DJMixAlbum` JSON-LD, an RSS `<category>`, sitemap entries, and an llms.txt Mixtapes section. Runbook + spine model: **[packages/skills/fluncle-mixtapes](../packages/skills/fluncle-mixtapes)**.

What PR #22 changed: the `/admin/mixtapes` editor now **collapses** each mixtape to a summary row and edits members through a search + drag-reorder **playlist builder** (`@dnd-kit`, searching findings by Log ID / artist / title); **covers render on the fly** via `workers-og`/Satori at `/api/mixtape-cover/<logId>?size=square|og|wide`, derived from the Log ID — the per-mixtape Remotion render and the `cover_image_url` column are gone (`render:mixtape-bg` bakes the shared background once); and a **draft is now the operator-authored subset** (recordedAt, duration, note, tracklist), with the title, Log ID, and cover all minted/derived at publish. The first mixtape, **`019.F.1A`** ("Fluncle Drum & Bass Mixtape #1", 17 findings, 72 min liquid), is published and fanned out; Mixcloud / YouTube / SoundCloud are live (#1 uploaded by hand; the autopublish `distribute` command handles this going forward).

**Autopublish shipped** (validated end-to-end 2026-06-20). One `fluncle admin mixtapes distribute` command pushes a mixtape's video→YouTube + audio→Mixcloud on our own server-side OAuth (`youtube_auth` / `mixcloud_auth`), mint-first into a non-public `distributing` state, the first successful link flips it public; the CLI streams the bytes, the Worker mints the coordinate and records each leg. The `fluncle://<logId>` note breadcrumb (external descriptions only) is built at upload. SoundCloud and the MusicBrainz/Wikidata loop stay manual by design. How-to: the [fluncle-mixtapes skill](../packages/skills/fluncle-mixtapes).

What's left:

- **Off-site (low priority).** Keep enriching Wikidata `Q140169844` as facts accumulate (the MusicBrainz DJ-mix release [`fc818504`](https://musicbrainz.org/release/fc818504-6c01-4565-be1e-d1b3657f8a7c)) — tracked in the off-site thread above.

Out of scope until needed: a teaser-clip-of-a-mixtape pipeline, and the Galaxy-game checkpoint body at the mixtape's sector.

### Private preview archive — move to a non-public bucket

Shipped (PR #6): enrichment stores the exact official 30s preview used for the feature vector at an operator-only path (`analysis/previews/<log-id>/<sha256>.<ext>`), excluded from every public DTO/UI/RSS/sitemap and from `/api/preview` (public playback stays live-only: stored Deezer → refreshed-by-ISRC → iTunes, `Cache-Control: no-store`; R2 is never the playback source). **Open follow-up:** it currently lives in the public `fluncle-videos` bucket, so its privacy rests only on the unguessable key — move it to a dedicated **non-public** R2 bucket before relying on it as training input. The columns stay inert until the first archive write, so there's runway. (Training consumer: the vibe-placement model below.)

### TikTok audio line-up (build only when a track breaks)

On standby — most relevant during the content backlog. The video is beat-matched to a Deezer/iTunes 30s preview (a fixed mid-song segment); TikTok's attachable sound is usually — not always — the song's first ~60s, trimmable to any start within the span it exposes. When the preview segment isn't reachable there and the track has no obvious section to line up by ear, the visuals pulse to beats that aren't playing. **Stage 0 (now):** by-ear line-up. **Stage 1 (on break):** full-track audio for analysis only via Apify `apidojo/youtube-scraper` (stream URL → ffmpeg → analyze → discard, never stored or served). **Stage 2:** pick the best ~20s window inside the first ~55s, render to it, write the absolute start offset into `render.json` + surface it ("start the sound at 0:42"). Audio policy: YouTube audio is internal-analysis-only; published audio uses official previews. AcousticBrainz-by-ISRC is frozen (~2022/24), so it is not a BPM fallback for new tracks.

### Optimize web playback (clips are all transform-eligible now)

Re-rendering the oversized clips is **done** — every R2 footage file, with-audio and silent, is under Cloudflare's 100 MB transform ceiling (verified 2026-06-17; largest ~95 MB, a few sit close so watch the pipeline's CRF doesn't drift back up). The core playback layer also shipped: `apps/web/src/lib/media.ts` serves same-zone Media Transformation renditions (a 360/480/720/1080 width ladder via `videoRendition`) + a cheap `mode=frame` poster (`videoPoster`), with a one-shot `onError` fallback to the raw master.

What's left is a real before/after measurement on a mobile connection: throttled-mobile bytes-on-load and time-to-first-frame on real glass. The playback paths are in place around it — the feed carries no video, the Stories player streams via range requests, and the log-page footage defers its fetch until it nears the viewport — so the open item is verifying the win, not building more deferral.

Re-ship caveat (for the content-backlog loop too): replacing a clip at the same `<log-id>/footage.mp4` key needs the transform renditions purged, not just the master — they cache under separate keys, and purge propagation lags per-colo (the `mode=frame` poster clears slower than the `mode=video` rendition, so check from the affected location before assuming it's stuck). To force an instant flip, version the transform source in `media.ts` (`?v=N` on the `footage.mp4` source).

### YouTube thumbnails — backfill the back catalogue + guard the missing cover

Custom YouTube thumbnails are wired and on by default: the per-platform push derives `<log-id>/cover.jpg` from the footage path and `pushYouTubeShort` uploads it as `settings.thumbnail` (`apps/web/src/lib/server/postiz.ts`). It's been live since the admin posting board (`b16a5db`, 2026-06-13), so every Short pushed since carries the Fluncle plate; the Shorts published before it still show YouTube's auto-picked video frame. One follow-up, operator-side and low-priority (nothing is broken — new pushes are covered, and a missing cover degrades to a thumbnail-less push rather than failing):

- **Backfill the pre-`b16a5db` Shorts.** Postiz's create-post flow makes a _new_ video and has no "edit an existing video's thumbnail" call, so the live Shorts can't be retro-fixed through our path. Options: set each one's thumbnail manually in YouTube Studio (~7 videos, no code), or a one-off **YouTube Data API `thumbnails.set`** script that uploads `cover.jpg` per published Short. The script's blocker — "no direct YouTube credential in the repo" — is gone: the mixtape autopublish work shipped `youtube_auth` + `fluncle admin auth youtube` (our own upload-scoped OAuth), so the backfill is now a trivial reusable `thumbnails.set` script reusing that credential.

## Later — the bigger arcs

### Fluncle's Galaxy — the logbook reframe

The largest arc, the one the others point at. A **co-equal reframe**: Fluncle is a cosmonaut keeping a logbook, every discovery a **log entry** with a permanent, surface-independent identity (`fluncle://<id>`), the banger the artifact attached to an observation. The log becomes as central as the music — real canon surgery, not a bolt-on; the music-first product and the warm uncle keep their weight, the journey is the second axis.

One identity, many representations:

```
fluncle://241.7.3A
  ├─ fluncle.com/log/241.7.3A    (web: a log page, not a row)
  ├─ on-screen overlay + caption (TikTok)
  ├─ <guid> in the RSS feed       (the observation feed)
  ├─ fluncle log 241.7.3A         (CLI)
  ├─ ssh rave.fluncle.com 241…    (the recovered terminal)
  └─ social_post reconciliation key
```

The spine (the Log ID) already runs across surfaces; what's ahead:

- **New surfaces:** `/log/<id>` pages (the log as object — observation, recovered artifact, related logs), RSS as the observation feed, possibly Discord. The site becomes an archive you browse, not only a feed you scroll. This subsumes the auto-pipeline's reconciliation marker — one identity does the trail and the reconciliation.
- **Canon surgery (resolve as one decision, not piecemeal):** PRODUCT.md gains a co-primary log/observation thesis; VOICE.md formalizes the logbook register as the deep end of the Depth Gradient (SSH / archive / RSS speak as a "recovered terminal," the warm uncle still holds web / Telegram / email; "transmission" and "signal" stay banned, adopt log / observation / discovery / archive / recovered / artifact / sector; "banger" stays primary); DESIGN.md gains the log-page / archive panes (Oxanium, tabular, instrument-panel calm).

### Fluncle's Galaxy — the game (v1 live)

v1 shipped 2026-06-10 at [galaxy.fluncle.com](https://galaxy.fluncle.com) (same Worker, `/galaxy` route): behind-the-ship 8-bit flight where every banger is a star at its Log ID coordinate, the nearest uncollected preview fades in by distance and pans by bearing, reaching a star parks you in an orbit listening moment that refuels the tank, dry tank means towed home at `0/N`, and `N/N` opens the fly-home win with a credits roll of the full log. Touch + keyboard, Esc pause, the `window.fluncle` flight computer easter egg, audio through the same-origin `/api/preview/:idOrLogId` proxy (live Deezer/iTunes only; archived previews are not a playback source). Shares the Log ID spine with the logbook reframe; the shipped design decisions live in the code and git history. What's ahead:

**The entity spine (landed, PR #7).** The world is now data-driven: stars, set-dressing, hazards, and projectiles are one typed `Entity` model with a per-kind behavior table (`game/types.ts` + `sim.ts`), backed by the pure-state tests it was missing (`sim.test.ts`, `entities.test.ts`). Riding that spine: Roadster + UFO set-dressing, the black-hole teleport network (gravity in, slingshot out — never a restart; subsumes the old worm-hole idea), asteroid waves + an auto-clearing laser, the amen-break intro + master volume toggle, and the gate-screen OG image (`packages/media`). Every hazard routes through the fuel economy; the dry-tank tow stays the one true failure. This is the same sim spine the SSH RFC reuses wholesale.

**Near polish:**

- **Announce to the crew:** post the game to Telegram + the Friday letter once the near-polish lands. (The `/galaxy` sitemap entry and the gate-screen OG image already shipped.)
- **Bespoke sprites:** the new bodies (Roadster, UFO, asteroid) draw on procedural fallbacks today; the bespoke Nano-Banana PNGs (same workflow as ship/earth, see `docs/galaxy-sprites.md`) drop into `public/galaxy/` over them. The black hole is procedural by design.
- **Economy tuning from a real full clear** (10–15 min target): burn rates, refuel dwell, cruise/boost speeds, plus the new frontier dials — black-hole influence/pull radii and system count, asteroid wave density, laser cooldown, amen volume/fade. One human playthrough decides (out of agent scope by design).
- **Real-device mobile pass:** thumb zones on actual glass, safe-areas, the dynamic address bar, performance on a mid phone (now with more entities + the film pass).
- **SFX pass:** the square-wave kit gained warp / bolt / asteroid-hit voices; richer 8-bit when it itches.
- **Boot cinematic upgrade** (v1 is minimal + skippable).

**The expanding frontier (the content engine):** the Log ID sector is days since the Fluncle epoch and maps to distance from Earth, deliberately uncompressed — the galaxy literally grows outward as findings land, full clears get longer, and that pressure is what future content answers. The entity spine now makes this real: set-dressing and hazard density already rise with distance from Earth, and the black-hole network scales with the catalogue. Still ahead: **new home planets as forward bases / respawn + refuel hubs** (overlaps persistence), derelicts and lore nodes. The further from Earth, the stranger the universe — near space is the warm early catalogue, the frontier is the new-and-scary flicker.

**Backlog (still open):**

- **Worm holes as a distinct entity** — deferred: the black-hole teleport network now carries the "shortcut to the far side" flavor; a separate worm-hole only if it earns its own navigation.
- **Other planets / forward bases** — future, tied to persistence (refuel hubs / respawn points out on the frontier).
- **The bespoke sprite menagerie** beyond the heroes (see Near polish).

**SSH version (the flex)** — **landed in code and deployed live (PR #13)**. The approach pivoted: instead of compiling `sim.ts` to WASM (Javy/QuickJS → wazero), the SSH galaxy is a **Go port** of the sim (`apps/ssh/internal/galaxy` — engine/placement/projection) kept in lockstep by **parity tests** against the JS source (`apps/web/src/game/parity-fixtures.test.ts` + testdata), wired into the terminal (`screenGalaxy` / `handleGalaxyKey` in `apps/ssh/main.go`). The same _sim_ inside `ssh rave.fluncle.com`, then: a top-down scope renderer, the read-the-log orbit card with an OSC-8 Spotify link, audio-less as flavor ("the audio didn't survive the trip out here — it's still playing back on Earth"), telemetry in the deepest Depth-Gradient register taken from the shipped strings ("Pulled under. Flung across the galaxy." · "Home, junglist."). Map knowledge is portable across surfaces — the Log ID spine paying off. The working Go port + parity harness resolve the old PASS/KILL spikes (SSH input latency; the engine model) and the "confirm realtime input + frame rate" question. **Deployed and live at `rave.fluncle.com` (2026-06-17)** — the Minimum Lovable galaxy shipped whole, the same _sim_ inside the terminal. Remaining are named fast-follows: SSH experience polish, QR / Kitty-input / ambient-crew.

**Persistence:** web private accounts now sync lifetime Galaxy progress without changing active-run cargo. Cross-surface login for SSH/CLI remains future work; anonymous play stays first-class.

### User accounts

The private web account layer shipped in PR #19: Better Auth email/password + username, `/account`, private Galaxy lifetime progress, saved findings, signed-in submission ownership, export/delete, durable DB-backed rate limits, CSRF-bound account mutations, and hard separation from admin auth. Anonymous browse, submit, RSS, MCP, CLI, SSH, and Galaxy play remain unchanged.

Follow-ups are deliberately separate from the first private web slice:

- **Cross-surface account login:** CLI/SSH device login for synced Galaxy lifetime markers, saved findings, and own submissions. User tokens must stay separate from `FLUNCLE_API_TOKEN`, and SSH stays anonymous by default.
- **Authenticated MCP tools:** only if there is a concrete agent use case; keep the existing MCP server/card anonymous until a dedicated auth contract, CORS/header behavior, and failure model exist.
- **Public marginalia RFC:** public crew cards, public submission credit, crew notes, reports, moderation, and profile-like surfaces need their own RFC before implementation. Hard default remains no public writing.
- **Email/password hardening:** decide verification/reset policy, abuse thresholds, disposable-email handling, and support copy once real usage shows the pressure points.
- **Account ops polish:** keep the account env vars prominent (`BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `BETTER_AUTH_URL`) and do a real-data privacy pass on export/delete after a few accounts exist.

### TikTok auto-pipeline (the capstone) + Spinup automation

"Maurice discovers bangers, Fluncle does everything else." Add a track via `ssh rave.fluncle.com` and the system enriches → renders → captions → pushes a draft automatically; the human steps stay manual on purpose (attach the official sound, finish, publish). The draft-publishing layer runs today by hand — now through the **`/admin` board** (per-platform status, push, copy-caption, asset downloads). What's left to make it autonomous:

- **Render: Superset on the laptop now, Spinup later.** Rendering runs hands-off via the hourly **Superset Automation** on the MacBook (see Now → "Hands-off rendering") — too heavyweight for Spinup today, and the laptop's GPU is free. The fully-server-side **render-capable Spinup profile** stays deferred: software-GL (SwiftShader) is viable (~1.45× Metal, no GPU needed) but needs a render rootfs (Chromium + SwiftShader / Mesa / fonts + ffmpeg), likely >1 vCPU, a check against the per-run cap, and an answer to how an ephemeral agent gets the `packages/video` kit (fresh checkout per run, a prebuilt image, or a published package). Pursue it only when laptop-bound rendering becomes the bottleneck.
- **Autonomous trigger — the enrich step is live (commit `05a3f81`).** The enrichment-analysis agent runs on Spinup (hermes harness; `analyze-track` is a self-contained skill, no repo checkout — ffmpeg + the `fluncle` CLI bound), and the Worker fires its async `runs.create` on track-add: admin-gated, Worker-only, via `@getspinup/sdk` (inline `await`, since this TanStack version doesn't expose Cloudflare's `ctx.waitUntil`; sets `enrichmentStatus: processing`). Extending the chain to **render → publish** is the remaining autonomy, gated on the render-capable Spinup profile above.
- **Reconciliation.** Recording an outcome by hand works for any post now — the status endpoint **upserts** (PR #14), so a manually-published or cross-environment post can be marked `published` (with the live URL) even without a prior draft row. Still open: the **automatic** version — an hourly check matching recent posts to the `fluncle://<log-id>` marker and flipping `social_posts.status` itself, observed not hand-entered.
- **More platforms — YouTube done, the autopilot-ready channel; Instagram closed.** YouTube Shorts ships now (PR #13): a direct public upload (title + caption + `cover.jpg` thumbnail) via the per-platform push, recorded in `social_posts`. Because it needs **no manual finish** (unlike TikTok's in-app official sound), YouTube is the one channel that can run **fully on autopilot** — once the autonomous trigger above chains enrich → render → publish, YouTube publishes hands-off with nothing left for the human. (Flagged, not urgent.) Instagram is **deferred — not posting yet** (the `@fluncle` account exists, but the music-licensing exposure isn't worth it for now): there's no legitimate API audio path (the master gets muted on a business/creator account, and IG's licensed audio is app-only), so it would mean silent clips or manual in-app posts under that risk. Parked, not closed; see the autonomy ladder's _Deferred_ group. Per-platform doctrine lives in `docs/track-lifecycle.md` (Phase 3) + the `fluncle-publish` skill.

### Live on Twitch — the "on the decks" callout across surfaces

When Maurice goes live on Twitch to mix, the Galaxy should light up: a live callout that fans out across the surfaces while the stream is on and clears itself the moment it ends. The one loud moment in an otherwise quiet, cover-led product — Fluncle's in the booth, the crew gathers, then it's gone. Twitch presence is already wired (`twitchUrl` in `fluncle-links`, the home social row, the entity `sameAs`, the `docs/socials/` map); this is the live-state layer on top. The scheduled-ahead half also shipped: `/calendar.ics` publishes any mixtape's `plannedFor` as a Twitch-linked VEVENT (subscribe before it happens), so what remains here is specifically the **live-now** callout, not the calendar.

The shape:

- **Detect live state.** Twitch Helix `Get Streams` (`?user_login=fluncle`) polled on a Worker cron, or — better, push not poll — an **EventSub** subscription to `stream.online` / `stream.offline` hitting a Worker webhook. Store a small transient "live" flag (KV or a row) with the stream title/start; surfaces read it, and `stream.offline` (or a poll miss) clears it so nothing goes stale.
- **Fan out, then auto-clear.** A tasteful banner/callout on the web home + feed (quiet, dark, reduced-motion-safe — the calm aesthetic holds, this is the _one_ allowed loud beat), a ping to the crew on Telegram (a "live now" message with the watch link, pinned for the duration), and a line in the dry surfaces (the CLI `recent` header / the SSH MOTD). Every surface reads the same flag; when it flips off, every callout disappears on its own.
- **Voice.** In-fiction as "on the decks" / "live in the booth" / "rinsing a set live" — never "transmission", "signal", or "stream" as identity (the banned set in VOICE); "live" as the literal Twitch state is fine. Dry and warm, the crew addressed directly; the callout brags as little as the rest of the copy.

Gated on nothing structural — it's net-new surface plumbing, sized as a single arc when live mixing becomes a regular thing.

### Brand & canon

- **Moodboard → canon audit (video-side remainder)** — the web overhaul resolved the web half (the logbook plate, ignition hovers, the grain architecture, and the archive grammar are in DESIGN.md now). Still open per concept: whether the video-kit proofs (texture families' full grammar, vehicle grammar, One-Sun-through-the-vehicle) get promoted into canon or stay video-local; cross-link, don't duplicate.

### Newsletter agent (Spinup)

The Friday newsletter agent ([docs/agents/newsletter-agent.md](./agents/newsletter-agent.md)) is configured on Spinup (slug `fluncle-s-newsletter-97bwtd`, hermes harness, `~anthropic/claude-haiku-latest`) and produces a complete draft: it reads the discovery window from `/api/tracks`, groups the finds by galaxy (Solar → Nebular → Lunar → Astral; unplaced finds under "Also found"), gathers scene tidbits via firecrawl, and stages a Loops campaign. **The send stays a manual operator step by design — Loops has no programmatic campaign-send (CLI / SDK / API / docs all confirm; dashboard-only), so this is not a gap to close.** Remaining: confirm the Friday cadence, and keep enough findings tagged (see the vibe-placement item) that the galaxy grouping isn't all "Also found."

### Vibe-placement model (auto-tag the map)

Findings are grouped by **vibe**, not sub-genre — the admin tagging tool (shipped; [docs/admin-tagging.md](./admin-tagging.md)) places each one on a 2-axis map stored as a coordinate: `vibe_x` = Light↔Dark mood, `vibe_y` = Floaty↔Driving energy; the quadrant is the finding's galaxy (Solar / Nebular / Lunar / Astral). Those coordinates are the **training labels** for a small model that will eventually auto-place new finds.

The dataset is already self-assembling: every placed finding is a clean row of `features_json` (the spectral vector the enrichment agent already stores — `centroidHz`, `highRatio`, `midFlatness`, `onsetRate`, `subBassRatio`) → `(vibe_x, vibe_y)`. Inputs and labels are both captured today; nothing extra is needed to build it.

**Deliberately NOT auto-suggested yet.** With no trained model, any suggestion would be a hand heuristic — and pre-filling the marker would _anchor_ the operator and bias the very labels the model needs (the same imprecision we deleted with the old sub-genre `suggestTags`). Manual placement from the audio is the clean ground truth; collect that first.

The plan:

- **Revisit at ~50–100 placements.** As of 2026-06-11 there are 26 findings; the operator is labeling the backlog around 2026-06-12, so a first dataset is days away. Once there's a meaningful set, **start training a small model** `features → (vibe_x, vibe_y)` — k-nearest-neighbours over the feature vector or ridge regression is plenty at this scale (no infra needed) — and measure what accuracy is achievable with what we have. The early read tells us whether the audio features carry enough signal or whether the feature set needs widening.
- **Once a model is confident, extend the enrichment skill with it.** Add the prediction to `packages/skills/fluncle-track-enrichment` (`analyze-track.ts`) so enrichment emits a suggested `(vibe_x, vibe_y)`; the tagging tool pre-fills it and the operator **verifies/adjusts**, and those corrections feed back as active-learning data. That auto-tag-then-verify loop is the long-term win — switched on only after the clean manual labels exist.

Unnecessarily fun — that's the point.

### Auto-drafted finding notes (the enrichment agent's editorial pass)

The board now takes an optional **note** per finding — the editorial "why" that renders on the `/log/<id>` page and feeds its definitional prose + `MusicRecording` schema, so a note is real SEO/AEO value, not just operator chrome. Writing one per finding by hand is the bottleneck, and the agent can take a first pass.

The notes encode Maurice's **subjective** read — where he placed the finding on the vibe map, how it sits in its galaxy — not its objective spectral numbers. So the neighbours to draw from must be nearest in **vibe** (the placed `vibe_x`/`vibe_y`, same galaxy), NOT in `features_json`: two tracks can measure nearly identical yet land in different galaxies by feel, and a feature-twin's note would carry the wrong vibe. That is why this is **downstream of the vibe-placement model above** — a new finding needs a vibe coordinate before it has vibe-neighbours, and in the autonomous chain that coordinate comes from the model (features → predicted `vibe_x`/`vibe_y`). The features are the model's input; the note's neighbours live in the vibe space the model produces.

The shape: enrich → the vibe model places the finding → pull the notes of its **nearest neighbours in vibe space** (closest `vibe_x`/`vibe_y`, same galaxy) → the agent synthesizes a fresh, finding-specific note grounded in the galaxy's character and the audio (driving-dark Nebular vs floaty-light Lunar; the BPM, key, texture), in Fluncle's voice via the `copywriting-fluncle` skill → the operator verifies and edits, and that edit grows the corpus. Guardrails: the cluster informs but never templates (the same anti-sameness discipline as the parallel-render attractor — a note that reads like every other note in its galaxy is worse than none), never fabricate scene history or facts, and only draft when there's real signal; the note stays optional, so silence beats a generic line.

Gated on the **vibe-placement model** (for the coordinate) and a **notes corpus** to draw from (the board's note column is filling it now). Lives in `packages/skills/fluncle-track-enrichment` alongside the `(vibe_x, vibe_y)` prediction. (A finding that's already manually tagged has its coordinate now, so the neighbour-in-vibe approach can be prototyped on the current set before the model lands — just not autonomously.)
