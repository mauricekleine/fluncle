# demand-sweep.sh — the `--no-agent` demand cron's job ENTRY (`fluncle-demand`). The nightly
# demand-driven reorder of crawl/capture priority (docs/catalogue-crawler.md § Demand).
#
# Version-controlled source; the repo is canonical and the box is a deploy target
# (fluncle-hermes-operator skill). This pair is BAKED into the image at /opt/hermes-scripts/ and
# auto-updates from main via pin-watch; a rave-02 HOST systemd timer docker-execs it once a day —
# no docker cp. See ../demand-timer/README.md. Box activation is OPERATOR-GATED (a new cron;
# nothing to retire).
#
# Why a .sh that execs a .ts: the host timer runs the sweep as `bash <sweep>.sh`, so this thin
# wrapper is the bash entry; all the JSON work lives in the bun orchestrator beside it
# (demand-sweep.ts). Its stdout is the cron's run output.
#
# THE WORKER-PACED MODEL (the reach-collect / catalogue-rank shape): the box holds NO Simple
# Analytics key; the WORKER holds it and does the fetch. So this driver just fires
# `fluncle admin catalogue demand` ONCE — the Worker reads the `/artist/<slug>` + `/label/<slug>`
# pageviews and rewrites the two derived reorder columns (`tracks.demand_score` +
# `crawl_frontier.demand_rank`), a rank-order-only, idempotent, within-tier reorder. A same-window
# re-run lands the same columns. `record_demand` is AGENT tier, so the box's existing agent-scoped
# token drives it — NO new secret. Zero LLM tokens.
#
# Scheduled by a repo-checked-in HOST systemd timer (../demand-timer/, installed by
# ../install-host-timers.sh), which `docker exec`s it in the container. Per-run output is a freshness
# marker the sweep self-writes via cron-output.sh under ~/.hermes/cron/output/fluncle-demand/
# (read by the /status prober). See ../cron/README.md.
