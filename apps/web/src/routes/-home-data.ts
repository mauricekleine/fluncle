// the other route-logic tests use, e.g. `-artist-page.ts`).
//
// Server-rendering the first page keeps the archive readable for crawlers (search engines and AI
// agents alike) that never execute JavaScript. Alongside it we resolve the newest finding WITH
// footage across the whole archive, so the cover's story ring opens the viewer at the latest story
// even when that story isn't on the first page (it usually isn't, once newer findings land before
// their footage does). Same ordering as the stories feed, so it lines up.
