// The label entity's backing functions — the `artists.ts` / `galaxies-map.ts` twin,
// consumed by the oRPC handlers (`./orpc/admin-labels.ts`), the `/admin/labels`
// route loader, the attention queue's read, and the publish path's upsert.
//
// ── THE ONE RULE: `seed_state` IS CRAWL SCOPE, NEVER STORAGE ────────────────────
// A label's seed state answers exactly one question — MAY THE FUTURE CATALOGUE
// CRAWLER SEED FROM THIS LABEL? Disabling a label removes it from the NEXT crawl's
// seed set and touches nothing already stored: no deletion, no hiding, no
// retroactive effect on tracks, on findings, or on anything a previous crawl
// brought in. There is deliberately NO function in this module that reads
// `seed_state` to decide what is shown, kept, or removed — and there must never be
// one. `listSeedLabels("enabled")` is the ONLY consumer shape: the seed set the
// crawler will read when it exists. See docs/label-entity.md.
//
// Identity is the SLUG, not the name. `tracks.label` stays the raw captured string
// forever (the audit trail and the re-normalization input); a label row is related
// to it by `slugify(tracks.label) = labels.slug`, which is what folds `Pilot.` and
// `Pilot` into one label without a destructive rewrite of the findings. SQLite has
// no `slugify`, so the fold happens here in TS over a bounded `GROUP BY label` read
// (one row per DISTINCT label, never a row per track).

 * it"), so the two reads have to differ.
 *
 * ── THE FLOOR IS APPLIED IN SQL ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

 * it walks past and most will sit on one or two rows, so filtering in TypeScript would drag

 * filter a growing table in the Worker). `minTracks` is the caller's constant, so the gate
 * has exactly one definition and the page and the sitemap cannot drift apart.
