// The `admin-frontier` domain contract module — the weekly Frontier refresh (E2, the

// Frontier playlist from their current recommendations.

/**
 * `refresh_frontier_playlists` → `POST /admin/frontier-playlists/refresh`
 * (operationId `refreshFrontierPlaylists`).
 *
 * ADMIN tier (adminAuth only, no operatorGuard): the box's weekly `fluncle-frontier-
 * refresh` cron drives it with the agent-scoped token — the `advance_publish_queue` /
 * `rank_catalogue` precedent (the Worker owns the Spotify grant; the box only triggers).
 * It creates NO new public authority the operator did not already give: every playlist
 * it touches already exists, minted by its own owner.
 *
 * A PACED, RESUMABLE DRAIN (not a one-shot burst): each tick processes up to `limit` DUE
 * committed users — PENDING MINTS first, then oldest-refreshed — stamping a durable per-user
 * cursor as it goes, so the whole crew refreshes ~weekly spread across ticks instead of one
 * overloaded pass that 429'd Spotify's shared per-app budget. It writes the next edition for
 * every processed user REGARDLESS of the kill switch (the edition is the shelf's source of
 * truth); only the Spotify mirror stays conditional (`switchOff` is reported for observability,
 * never a short-circuit). When minting is open, the pass consults the shared Spotify budget and
 * STOPS cleanly when the window is spent (`budgetPaused: true`) — the cursor resumes next tick.
 * A draft-phase user with zero editions is skipped by construction. Best-effort per user: one
 * Spotify fault is counted in `failed` and the walk continues. The counts are the sweep's JSON
 * summary.
