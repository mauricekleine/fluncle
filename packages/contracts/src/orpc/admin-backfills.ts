// The `admin-backfills` domain contract module — the operator-gated maintenance
// sweeps (the Discogs + Last.fm back-fills). Part of the admin fan-out, built on
// the same pattern as `./admin-tracks.ts`.
//
//   - `backfill_discogs` / `backfill_lastfm` — operator tier (live
//     `requireOperator`). Batched: one request handles a bounded pass and returns
//     `nextCursor`; the CLI loops `?cursor=` until null.
//
// The inputs are the live QUERY params (`limit`/`dryRun`/`cursor`), kept as
// tolerant optional strings: the live routes parse + clamp them in-handler and
// never 400 on a malformed value, so the contract must not coerce (coercion would
// reject `?limit=abc`). The handler reproduces the exact parse logic.
//
// These are query-only POSTs (the live routes carry their params on the URL, with
// NO request body). oRPC's compact input mode sources a POST's input from the
// BODY, so it would drop the query string; `inputStructure: "detailed"` makes the
// `query` explicit, so the params reach the handler and a bodyless POST is valid.
// The OUTPUT stays compact (the body is the envelope directly).

 * zero-matched residual (a track it stamped but wrote no edge, because no credited name folded to an

 * MusicBrainz recording identity (`mb_recording_id`, or the `mb_<recording-mbid>` PK a crawler-born

 * client names its credited artists WITH their MB artist ids. Each resolves down a three-rung ladder:
 * an EXACT `mbid` match, else an ADOPT (the credit name folds unambiguously onto an existing artist
 * with no mbid — the common case, since the residual is dominated by compound credit strings whose
 * members Fluncle already holds as Spotify-keyed rows; adopting instead of minting is what stops this
 * sweep spawning split-identity duplicates), else a MINT of a fresh identity-true row. The
 * `track_artists` edges are then written. A zero-matched track with NO MB identity is TERMINALLY
 * SKIPPED. It writes catalogue-graph identity only (no publish, no certification), so the box's
 * agent-token cron drives it, the `backfill_recording_mbids` precedent. Its OWN reliability stamp
 * (`artist_credits_backfilled_at`) — DISTINCT from slice 0's, whose semantics it never disturbs.
 * Worker-paced (1 req/s, circuit-broken on a throttle) with a 60s response budget. Returns `{ ok,
