// The `admin-catalogue` domain contract module — THE CATALOGUE, both halves.
//
// A CATALOGUE TRACK is a row in `tracks` with NO row in `findings`: a track Fluncle knows
// about and has not certified. The domain carries two complementary jobs, and they arrived as
// two PRs. THE CRAWLER makes the rows exist; THE EAR makes the pile useful.
//
//   THE CRAWLER (docs/catalogue-crawler.md) — metadata acquisition, and nothing else:
//   - `crawl_catalogue`  — admin tier (agent-allowed write): one bounded, resumable pass of the
//     MusicBrainz walk outward from the labels the OPERATOR enabled. It writes catalogue rows
//     and never a `findings` row, and it captures no audio.
//   - `get_crawl_status` — admin tier (agent-allowed read): the crawl frontier's state.
//
//   THE EAR (docs/the-ear.md) — the ranked read over what the crawler brought back:
//   - `list_catalogue_tracks` — admin tier (agent-allowed read): the ranked catalogue, through
//     one of two lenses. `ear` is "closest to your findings, not yet logged"; `capture` is
//     "whose audio should we buy next".
//   - `rank_catalogue` — admin tier (AGENT-allowed write): one tick of the precompute sweep. It
//     writes only derived ranking columns on catalogue rows — no coordinate, no note, no
//     certification, and never a finding — so it is a machine job like `update_galaxy_map`,
//     not an editorial act like `update_galaxy`.
//
//   THE CAPTURE BUDGET (docs/the-ear.md § The capture budget) — the brake on what the two
//   above lead to. The crawler is free (it moves metadata) and the Ear is free (it moves
//   vectors), but the audio CAPTURE those rows queue up for is metered: a residential proxy
//   bills per GB, and the queue drains whatever it is given.
//   - `get_capture_budget` — admin tier (agent-allowed read): the spend readout.
//   - `set_capture_budget` — OPERATOR tier: the caps and the kill switch. The one op in this
//     domain an agent may never call — a machine does not get to raise its own budget.
//
// Every op here EXCEPT `set_capture_budget` is agent-allowed, and that is not an oversight:
// none of them can certify anything, and none of them spends money. The two acts that steer
// the catalogue are the exceptions — RULING on a seed label (`update_label`, which decides
// what may be crawled at all) and SETTING the capture budget (which decides what may be
// bought) — and both stay OPERATOR tier.
//
// ── WHY THE TIER IS INTERNAL-ONLY ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The catalogue tier has NO PUBLIC NAME (the-archive RFC, D4): it is never labelled,
// introduced, or given a noun the crew could learn. `catalogue` is the INTERNAL word — code,
// docs, `/admin` — and there is deliberately no public op here. "Finding" stays the only named
// object in Fluncle's world.

/**
 * Which question the page asks of the catalogue.
 *
 *   - `ear`        — ranked by similarity to the NEAREST finding. The telescope.
 *   - `capture`    — ranked by the pre-audio priority ladder. A track has no vector until its
 *                    audio is captured, and capture is metered, so this lens answers the one
 *                    question the `ear` lens structurally cannot: who gets captured next.
 *   - `quarantine` — the WRONG-AUDIO holding pen (docs/the-ear.md § Wrong audio): rows whose
 *                    capture landed the wrong master (a near-1.0 cross-title match), vetoed from
 *                    the ear lens and re-queued for a fresh download. Its own quiet section so a
 *                    bad capture never silently vanishes, each row force-clearable by the operator.
 *   - `dismissed`  — the operator's "not for me" restore pile (docs/the-ear.md § The operator's
 *                    actions): rows he took out of the telescope. A REVERSIBLE veto, its own quiet
 *                    lens so a dismissal is never a black hole — each row carries a Restore.
 *   - `unmatched`  — the terminal "no acceptable candidate" verdicts, most-recently attempted
 *                    first: the observability window the 2026-07-14 audit lacked. Read-only;
 *                    the rescue is `requeue_unmatched_captures`.
 *   - `failed`     — the download-failure pile (cooling toward retry or past the failure cap),
 *                    most-recently attempted first. `unmatched`'s sibling window.

/**
 * Why a not-yet-captured track sits where it does in the capture queue. Two questions live here,
 * cleanly separated (RFC artist-primary-capture): AUTHORIZATION (may we spend a metered per-GB
 * byte on it at all?) is artist-driven; PRIORITY (among the rows we may buy, who first?) keeps the
 * old explainable ladder as an ordering hint. Among AUTHORIZED rows, strongest first: `artist` (a
 * credited artist is qualified, or a name is already on a finding), `label` (its label carries a
 * finding — a hint only now), `seed-label` (its label is one the operator seeds from), `none`.
 *
 * The two negatives are excluded from the capture queue by the same `capture_priority >= 0` SQL
 * predicate — money withheld, metadata welcome, the row kept and shown ranked last:
 *  - `skipped-label` (−1) is the VETO: its label is one the operator ruled OUT ("not our lane").
 *    Not decoration — every one of the 8 disabled labels CARRIES a finding (each arrived on a
 *    crossover remix), so without the veto the `label` rung fires on all of them and the metered
 *    budget goes on trance.
 *  - `unauthorized` (−3) is the softer withholding: no credited artist is qualified and the label
 *    is not `enabled`. It flips to authorized the moment an artist qualifies or the label is
 *    enabled — the reason most likely to change as the artist graph fills.
